Glitchy Button Game

Project Description..

The Glitchy Button Game is a fun and slightly frustrating mini-game where a button moves to a random position whenever the user tries to hover over it. The goal is to click the button to win the game. Once the user clicks it, a "You Win!" message is displayed, and the button disappears.

Features
✔️ A button that moves randomly when hovered over.
✔️ A message that appears when the user successfully clicks the button.
✔️ Simple and lightweight using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Try to move your mouse over the "Click Me" button.
The button will jump to a random position.
